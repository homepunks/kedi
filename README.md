# KEDI

A small 2D game built with [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) and [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) using the [naylib](https://github.com/planetis-m/naylib) bindings.

**Note:** The project is still in active development.

## Quickstart

> **Warning:** In case you want to use the make build tool, first create a ./build/

```console
nimble install naylib
nim c -o:./kedi ./src/main.nim

# enjoy
./kedi
```
